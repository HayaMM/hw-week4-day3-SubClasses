Abstract class don’t have to contain abstract methods, unlike interface all methods should be abstract.

Use abstract class when you want another classes to inherit from it, so they can implement its methods.

It’s good to use abstract class if you want to add new methods, unlike interface all classes that implement it should implement all new methods.

In abstract class you can declare non public members, unlike interface all its methods most be public.

Interface is better if the functionality will be used across disparate objects, 
an abstract class should be used primarily for objects that are related.

Interface should be implemented by another class, and we can’t create a direct object of that interface, 
so we have to inherit the class that implements the interface and create indirect objects.

An interface does not contain any constructors and it is implicitly abstract and public, 
so not need to use the abstract or public keywords while declaring it.
